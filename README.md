# Triglav Modular Voltage Processor
Eurorack voltage processor / ring modulator inspired by the Buchla 257.

Features:

* Two independent channels, each mixing an attenuverter, a voltage-controlled crossfader and an offset voltage (0-5V).
* „Ring” switches turn the crossfaders into ring modulators / bipolar VCAs.
* S-curve attenuverters for easier nulling.
* Can be trimmed precisely for 1V/oct signals
* LEDs indicating negative/positive voltage.


Other notes:
* Crossfader expects a 0-8V envelope in regular mode.
* Turning on the ring switch normalizes an inverted copy of the inputs into each other. This allows the crossfader to be used as a second attenuverter, a bipolar VCA or a ring modulator with adjustable bias without any additonal patching.
* 11 HP, compact design
* Panel + PCB sandwich, suitable for skiffs
* Reverse polarity protection
* Open source
